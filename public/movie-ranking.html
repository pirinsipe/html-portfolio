<h1>GREAT NETFLIX SHOWS FROM MY POV</h1>
<h2>2023 NETFLIX MOVIE AND SERIES<br>THAT I PERSONALLY LIKE.<br>(IN ANY ORDER)</h2>

<hr>

<h3>GLORY</h3>
<p>A little bit dark, it did not fail showing the violence and the atrocities of school bullying. <br>
The most satisfying part is watching the victim executing her years of plan of revenge to all her high school bullies.</p>

<h3>NIGHT AGENT</h3>
<p>A light action, entertaining, holywood formula netflix series.<br>
If you just want something of a familiar vibes with good action <br>
show to watch, then this is for you.</p>

<h3>THE LAST KINGDOM - SEVEN KINGS MUST DIE</h3>
<p>Watch this if you like a medieval norse and danes era movie.<br>
    This movie is a sequel of the series The Last Kingdom(which I also recommend).</p>
